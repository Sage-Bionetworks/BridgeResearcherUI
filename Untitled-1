3 months to beta:
    - there are a lot of external integrations here and new functionality;
    - that sounds possible as project time, but not as calendar time. This won't be done in 3 months
        unless we do nothing else and we all work on it (Alx, Dwayne, Eric at least, probably Shannon too);

    - this is not 4 months of calendar development time; in addition to every other project, there are also the holidays

Note: there will be no direct upload of genetic data to MSSM from the app itself.
    - how uploaded?

Return of the results of the initial genetic screen and instructions for how to initiate phase 2 of the study for individuals that will receive followup deep sequencing.
    - through app?

Ability to access data
    - scope

Notification that genetic testing is ready for viewing
    - based on reports they themselves will put in the app? This is a huge dependency on them to use Synapse and Bridge

p7 - includes a report that doesn't exist and would require work from MSSM as well to produce

p8 - how do you navigate between these panels? Scroll down? Presume sharing will not be an arrow...
    I would make signing up VERY prominent here and elsewhere

Generally having a anon/signed up variant of all these screens is a lot of work, confusing, and may not return that much value, I don't know.

p12 - in app notification tells user there is something to add.... wtf

p13 - I think what will happen in practice is most of this won't happen and this will end up being busy work. Just include it all in the overview to start with.
    - swipe to delete an element, have a way to reset the screen

I guess "Add Information Button" is how you participant... if so, that's HORRIBLE.

p15 - email integration that doesn't exist. Can be done from phone?
    - user profile data as to whether genetic info has been shared or not.

p18 - one time survey. probably doesn't repeat, just goes away? touchy.

p20 - genetic data... from where? It's not in Bridge. It's in Synapse but they can't access it there and in any event, what good is it in its native format? Also -- "CSV, BAM, and Word"

p25 - no server history, we could add it. There's some refactoring to do around this (doesn't sort by date right now).

p28 - add photo can be done, but why, it's all anonymous

p31 - this is all in app and it's just instruction screens?

p42 - needs to be renamed as Consent Agreement, etc. This isn't a EULA.

p43 - This isn't two toggles, it's a set of radio buttons, it's either/or.

p47 - synthesizes scheduled tasks and some other information. Not sure how this work will be divided up. It's possible you could inject events server-side that would trigger some of these as notifications. E.g. MSSM processes a kit and posts an event that this happened, and we have a schedule for a one-time task that is just a notification task. That in turn could trigger an on-app notification.

    - could do the same with articles, come to think of it. Haven't tested what happens when you update an event timestamp and there's another task out there already, think that would be fine. (No actually there are issues with this, need to think about it).

    - just need to add a generic worker-based API to add scheduled activity events to the system.

p119 - "please write Male, Female, Other" - just give them the right control for this, c'months

p124 - sharing of any kind is an excellent feature to cut for version 1.0.
