# BridgeResearcherUI

Study management application for Bridge researchers.

## Getting started

Install node and npm. We recommend using something like nvm to manage your node installation. Then in the directory where you would like to create a project directory: 

    npm install
    npm install webpack -g
    webpack
    
Run a server (localhost:8080)

    npm run server
    
Rebuild when a file changes

    npm run watch
    
Build a release

    npm run release

## Notes

Please try and include resources using npm rather than Bower. Two build tools (npm + webpack) are enough.
