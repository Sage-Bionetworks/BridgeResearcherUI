            <p>A survey can have many versions, each identified by the time it was created.</p>
            <p>To keep track of versions, we recommend you give each version a unique name, e.g. "Smoking questions added". (Participants do not see this.)</p>
            <p>Each version can be edited independently, as many times as desired. Once you publish it, however, the survey can no longer be modified.
            <p>You can only schedule published surveys. It is common to create a schedule that returns the most recently published version of a survey, so participants automatically receive updates to the survey. </p>
            <p><b>A participant's survey answers are recorded along with the specific version of the study the participant received.</b> </p>
            <p>[TODO] Confused yet? The most recently published version of a survey is the survey with the most recent createdOn timestamp (not modifiedOn timestamp) that is published. Don't even know how to describe this. </p>
