        <p>Clipboard items stay in the clipboard when you switch between studies. It allows you to copy items between two 
            studies. <b>When you add an item, any dependencies will be copied into the clipboard as well.</b> </p>
            
        <p>To maintain these dependencies, you are only allowed to copy everything in the clipboard to a target study you 
            sign in to, <em>or</em> to clear the clipboard and start over.</p>

        <p>We'll do the right thing for this to work. For example, if you copy a schedule that references a survey, 
            we'll copy over the survey and we'll published it too, so the survey will work in the new study. </p>

        <p>Copying within a study will also work: it will make copies of all the dependencies, or a "deep" copy rather than the 
            "shallow" copy available through the Copy command.
